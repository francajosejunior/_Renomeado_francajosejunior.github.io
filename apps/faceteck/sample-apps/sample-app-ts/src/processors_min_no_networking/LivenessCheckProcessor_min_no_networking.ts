// Welcome to the minimized FaceTec Device SDK code to launch User Sessions and retrieve 3D FaceScans (for further processing)!
// This file removes comment annotations, as well as networking calls,
// in an effort to demonstrate how little code is needed to get the FaceTec Device SDKs to work.

// NOTE: This example DOES NOT perform a Liveness Check.  To perform the Liveness Check, you need to actually make an API call.
// Please see the LivenessCheckProcessor file for a complete demonstration using the FaceTec Testing API.

import { FaceTecSDK } from "../../../../core-sdk/FaceTecSDK.js/FaceTecSDK.js";
import type { FaceTecSessionResult, FaceTecFaceScanResultCallback, FaceTecFaceScanProcessor } from "../../../../core-sdk/FaceTecSDK.js/FaceTecPublicApi.js";

export class LivenessCheckProcessor implements FaceTecFaceScanProcessor {
  constructor(sessionToken: string) {
    // Core FaceTec Device SDK code that starts the User Session.
    new FaceTecSDK.FaceTecSession(this, sessionToken);
  }

  public processSessionResultWhileFaceTecSDKWaits(sessionResult: FaceTecSessionResult, faceScanResultCallback: FaceTecFaceScanResultCallback) {
    // Normally a User will complete a Session.  This checks to see if there was a cancellation, timeout, or some other non-success case.
    if (sessionResult.status !== FaceTecSDK.FaceTecSessionStatus.SessionCompletedSuccessfully) {
      faceScanResultCallback.cancel();
      return;
    }

    // IMPORTANT:  FaceTecSDK.FaceTecSessionStatus.SessionCompletedSuccessfully DOES NOT mean the Liveness Check was Successful.
    // It simply means the User completed the Session and a 3D FaceScan was created.  You still need to perform the Liveness Check on your Servers.

    // These are the core parameters
    var parameters = {
      faceScan: sessionResult.faceScan,
      auditTrailImage: sessionResult.auditTrail[0],
      lowQualityAuditTrailImage: sessionResult.lowQualityAuditTrail[0]
    };

    // DEVELOPER TODOS:
    // 1.  Call your own API with the above data and pass into the Server SDK
    // 2.  If the Server SDK successfully processes the data, call proceedToNextStep(scanResultBlob), passing in the generated scanResultBlob to the parameter.
    //     If the Session Result object's isCompletelyDone value is true, the Session was successful and onFaceTecSDKCompletelyDone() will be called next.
    //     If the Session Result object's isCompletelyDone value is false, the Session will be proceeding to a retry of the FaceScan.
    // 3.  cancel() is provided in case you detect issues with your own API, such as errors processing and returning the scanResultBlob.
    // 4.  uploadProgress(yourUploadProgressFloat) is provided to control the Progress Bar.

    // faceScanResultCallback.proceedToNextStep(scanResultBlob)
    // faceScanResultCallback.cancel()
    // faceScanResultCallback.uploadProgress(yourUploadProgressFloat)
  }

  public onFaceTecSDKCompletelyDone() {
    // Entrypoint where FaceTec SDKs are done and you can proceed
  }
}
