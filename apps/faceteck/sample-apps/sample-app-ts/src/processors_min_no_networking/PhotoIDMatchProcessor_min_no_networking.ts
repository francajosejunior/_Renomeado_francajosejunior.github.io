// Welcome to the minimized FaceTec Device SDK code to launch User Sessions and retrieve 3D FaceScans (for further processing)!
// This file removes comment annotations, as well as networking calls,
// in an effort to demonstrate how little code is needed to get the FaceTec Device SDKs to work.

// NOTE: This example DOES NOT perform a secure Photo ID Scan.  To perform a secure Photo ID Scan, you need to actually make an API call.
// Please see the PhotoIDMatchProcessor file for a complete demonstration using the FaceTec Testing API.
